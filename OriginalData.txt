In this process, you will begin by establishing an imaginary checking account. In other words, there will be 
no actual bank involved, but you will make deposit entries and check withdrawals just as if it were an 
actual account. You could use an old checkbook system that is no longer in use, an accounting program in 
your computer, or you could even manufacture a complete system by using a notebook as your checkbook 
register and blank pieces of papers for your deposit slips and checks. It is of value to make this process 
feel as real to you as possible. 
On the first day, deposit $1,000. And spend it. In other words, make a S 1,000 deposit entry into your 
checkbook register, then write out checks to spend those dollars. You could spend your money all in one 
place, using one check, or you could spend it for several different things, using several different checks. 
The point of the game is to have fun thinking about what you would like to purchase, and to enjoy the 
process of actually writing out the checks. 
Be descriptive on the memo portion of the check. For example: For a beautiful writing pen or Great 
running shoes or Membership at Gordonâ€™s Health Spa. You can spend it all today, or save some of it for 
another day. However, we encourage you to do your best to spend it today, because tomorrow you will be 
making another wonderful deposit.
